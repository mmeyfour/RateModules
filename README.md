#  Rate Modules
### A small app with persistence data and MVC architecture
Our mini app RateModule has served us to apply a correction staffing for the course exercises.
It has a table view that shows the questions from each section with a dial switch to mark whether it was overcome or not.
We can also sail to a results screen to see the final note, broken down by section.
